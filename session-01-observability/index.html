                <h2>What is Google Cloud Observability?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Google Cloud Observability is a suite of tools designed to help you understand what's happening with your applications and workloads.</li>
                    <li>It helps you explore both the known and unknown issues underlying your workloads.</li>
                    <li>It begins with collecting signals, which include metric, logging, and trace data.</li>
                    <li>These signals are captured and integrated into Google products, from the hardware layer up.</li>
                    <li>The signal data flows into Google Cloud Observability tools for visualisation and analysis.</li>
                    <li>The goal is to provide precise insights into your Cloud installation.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>The Crucial Need for Observability</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Visibility into system health: Provides a clear mental model of how our application is working and reports on the overall health of systems.</li>
                    <li>Error reporting and alerting: Ensures problems are brought directly to our attention.</li>
                    <li>Efficient troubleshooting: Helps us fix issues quickly when something is broken.</li>
                    <li>Performance improvement: Guides us in optimising our systems.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Monitoring is the foundation of product reliability.</p>

                <h2>Deep Dive: Cloud Monitoring</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cloud Monitoring delivers real-time information about our systems.</li>
                    <li>Its purpose is to keep precise track of everything happening with resources launched in Google Cloud.</li>
                    <li>Benefits & What it Provides:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Product Reliability: It's the foundation for reliability.</li>
                            <li>In-Context Insights: Provides relevant telemetry data alongside your workloads within Google Cloud.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <h2>Cloud Monitoring: Visualising Data</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Metric data can be visualised in dashboards and through the Metrics Explorer.</li>
                    <li>We can create various types of charts to visualise metrics, such as resource consumption and application load.</li>
                    <li>These charts can then be used to build custom dashboards.</li>
                    <li>The data model for monitoring involves:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A metric field (including label and type) describing the metric.</li>
                            <li>A resource field (including label and resource information) from where metrics are collected.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>For more versatile interaction, we can leverage query languages like Monitoring Query Language (MQL) and PromQL.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Cloud Monitoring: Uptime Checks</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Beyond just metrics, Cloud Monitoring allows us to define uptime checks.</li>
                    <li>These checks track the liveliness and latency of our external-facing sites and services.</li>
                    <li>Creating uptime checks is a practical skill for maintaining reliability.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Cloud Logging is critical for the health and security of our cloud resources.</li>
                    <li>It enables us to collect, analyse, and export logging data.</li>
                    <li>The Logs Explorer is the tool to dissect and analyse automated and custom logs.</li>
                    <li>Log Analytics provides advanced capabilities, allowing us to run queries over logs for deeper insights.</li>
                    <li>Types of Logs Collected:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Google Cloud audit logs (Admin Activity, Data Access - requiring configuration).</li>
                            <li>Network telemetry data (VPC flow logs, GKE network, firewall, load balancer logs).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Logs can be exported for storage, analysis, or integration with other services.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Alerting Policies: Getting Notified</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>When problems arise (incidents), signal data can trigger automated alerts.</li>
                    <li>Alerts can notify key personnel through various channels.</li>
                    <li>The purpose of creating alerting policies is to help us identify and resolve problems quickly.</li>
                    <li>Alerts are typically configured to trigger when a service is down or when our Service Level Objectives (SLOs) or Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are at risk of not being met.</li>
                    <li>Key Terms:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Service Level Indicators (SLIs): Specific monitoring metrics chosen to measure service reliability from a user's perspective.</li>
                            <li>Service Level Agreements (SLAs): Formal commitments to users, often with contractual penalties.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
