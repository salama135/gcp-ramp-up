**Slide 6: Cloud Monitoring: Visualising Data**

*   Metric data can be visualised in **dashboards** and through the **Metrics Explorer**.
*   We can create various types of **charts** to visualise metrics, such as resource consumption and application load.
*   These charts can then be used to build **custom dashboards**.
*   The data model for monitoring involves:
    *   A **metric field** (including label and type) describing the metric.
    *   A **resource field** (including label and resource information) from where metrics are collected.
*   For more versatile interaction, we can leverage query languages like **Monitoring Query Language (MQL)** and **PromQL**. Understanding MQL's purpose is key.

**Slide 8: Deep Dive: Cloud Logging**

*   **Cloud Logging** is critical for the **health and security** of our cloud resources.
*   It enables us to **collect, analyse, and export logging data**.
*   The **Logs Explorer** is the tool to dissect and analyse automated and custom logs.
*   **Log Analytics** provides advanced capabilities, allowing us to run queries over logs for deeper insights. This is invaluable for quick troubleshooting, such as counting requests by type or severity.
*   **Types of Logs Collected:**
    *   Google Cloud **audit logs** (Admin Activity, Data Access - requiring configuration).
    *   **Network telemetry data** (VPC flow logs, GKE network, firewall, load balancer logs).
*   Logs can be exported for storage, analysis, or integration with other services.

**Slide 9: Logging for Security & Access Control**

*   Logs are essential for **investigating possible security events**.
*   We can use logs, particularly audit logs, to track actions within our Google Cloud environment. For example, finding all audit logs for a specific user.
*   **Managing Access to Logs:**
    *   Logs are stored in **log buckets**.
    *   **Log views** are used to control who can access logs within a bucket.
    *   Custom log views help protect sensitive data by restricting access to specific projects or users.
    *   It's crucial to use appropriate **IAM controls** on logs, granting only minimal necessary access.
    *   Be especially careful with **Data Access audit logs** as they may contain PII.
    *   **Sensitive Data Protection** can be integrated to redact PII in logs.

**Slide 10: Alerting Policies: Getting Notified**

*   When problems arise (incidents), **signal data** can trigger **automated alerts**.
*   Alerts can notify key personnel through various channels.
*   The purpose of creating alerting policies is to help us **identify and resolve problems quickly**.
*   Alerts are typically configured to trigger when a service is down or when our **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** or **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** are at risk of not being met.
*   **Key Terms:**
    *   **Service Level Indicators (SLIs):** Specific monitoring metrics (like the ratio of successful requests to total requests) chosen to measure service reliability from a user's perspective.
    *   **Service Level Objectives (SLOs):** Targets set based on SLIs [e.g., "99.9% of requests must succeed"]. Alerts are often tied to SLOs.
    *   **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** Formal commitments to users, often with contractual penalties. Alerting thresholds are usually set *higher* than SLA minimums to give us time to react before breaching the SLA.
